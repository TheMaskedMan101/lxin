# lxin
LXin is an experimental programming language designed to let you run and combine multiple programming languages inside a single .lx file, making it far easier to build multi-language projects without switching tools or managing separate scripts. It works using simple English-style commands that tell LXin what to do, with the main command being Luse, which lets you choose any supported language—such as Python, C#, or JavaScript—and place the code inside quotes so LXin can automatically pass it to the correct interpreter or compiler. LXin also includes platform-aware controls so you can make certain parts of your script run only on specific operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS, which is useful for cross-platform tools and automation. The language is expandable through lpipinstall, a command that lets LXin download extra modules, add-ons, or tools directly from sources like GitHub, giving it a growing ecosystem similar to pip for Python. Once installed, LXin adds helpful CMD commands such as lxin for running scripts, lxhelp for documentation, and lpipinstall for managing extensions, making it feel like a natural part of your system. LXin’s purpose is to be simple, powerful, and flexible, letting beginners learn multiple languages in one place and giving advanced users a way to create tools, games, prototypes, and automation scripts that combine the strengths of different programming languages. Rather than being just another language, LXin acts as a bridge that connects many languages into one unified workflow, making coding more open, creative, and accessible.
